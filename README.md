- Variables
- Data types
- Input & Output
- If/Else
- Loops
- Functions
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 🗂 File Naming
Files are named like `01.main.py`, `02.variables.py`, etc., following the order of topics in the tutorial.

## 📌 Purpose
This repository is mainly for:
- Tracking my learning progress
- Practicing coding
- Sharing my journey with others

Feel free to explore the files or follow along if you're also learning Python!
